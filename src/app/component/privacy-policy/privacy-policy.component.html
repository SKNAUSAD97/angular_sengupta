                <h5>NOTICE: On May 13th , 2017, Sengupta’s Research Academy adopted a Privacy Policy, providing as follows:</h5>
                <p>At Sengupta’s Research Academy (will be further referred to as SRA), we care about the confidentiality and security of your personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information secure in compliance with this Privacy Policy. “Personal Information” is defined below. As used in this Privacy Policy, “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to SRA.</p>
                <P>This Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the SRA Website (the “Site,” which consists of all content and pages located within the senguptasresearchacademy.com web domain) and does not apply to information that we may collect from you in other ways (for example, this policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us over the phone, by fax, or through conventional mail).</P>
                <h5>USERNAMES AND POSTINGS
                </h5>
                <p>Comments or other information posted by you to our forums, video lectures or other areas of the Site designed for public communications or communications among registered class members may be viewed and downloaded by others who visit the Site. For this reason, we encourage you to use discretion when deciding whether to post any information that can be used to identify you to those forums (or other public or classwide areas).

                </p>
                <h5>CONSENT TO PROCESSING OUTSIDE HOME COUNTRY</h5>
                <p>By using our Site, or providing information to SRA, you understand and unambiguously consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of information in India and other countries and territories, for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and the SRA Terms of Service. You hereby consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and retention by SRA of your Personal Information as described under this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to the transfer of your personal data between SRA and affiliates, and subsidiaries described in this Privacy Policy. For further certainty, any consent relating to a right to transfer information referred to in this paragraph shall be deemed to include your consent to the transfer of the applicable Personal Information to a jurisdiction which may provide a different level of privacy protection than that available in your own country.</p>
                <p>If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not access, browse, or register for the Site. If you choose not to provide us with certain information required to provide you with various services offered on our Site, you may not be able to establish a user account and we may not be able to provide you with those services.

We also collect certain usage information about students’ patterns of learning. In addition, we track information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls were used.
                </p>
                <p>We may log the IP address, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Site, and we may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Various web analytics tools are used to collect this information.

                In addition, we may share aggregated information that does not personally identify you with the public and with third parties, including but not limited to researchers and business partners.
            </p>
            <h5>USE FOR PERSONALIZATION AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS</h5>
            <p>Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner’s level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.</p>
            <h5>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h5>
            <p>The Site contains links to websites published by third parties, including other content providers as well as certain service providers, such as those who process payments on behalf of SRA. These other websites are not under our control, and you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by such websites, unless we have otherwise indicated in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to be aware when you are be redirected to a third party website and review the privacy policies of each website you visit and use.</p>
            <h5>SECURITY</h5>   
            <p>SRA has a program designed to protect Personal Information in its possession or control. This is done through a variety of privacy and security policies, processes, and procedures, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Information that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits. Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, SRA cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

SRA guarantees that it will not use the data submitted to it for any personal purposes or gains. Files that are not used or have been used in the past will be destroyed after their intended use. SRA will not share any files or content presented in these files uploaded to SRA.</p>
